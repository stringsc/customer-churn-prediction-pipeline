### Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a complete pipeline for predicting customer churn using machine learning. The project focuses on loading and preprocessing the data, training multiple models, evaluating their performance, and saving the trained models for later use.

Within Replit I have also created a website for viewing the customer data, their chances of churning, a summary of the cutomer themselves, and a personalized email.

## Features

-**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.


-**Model Training**: Training and evaluating six different machine learning models.


-**Model Evaluation**: Using a standardized evaluation function to compare model performance.


-**Model Persistence**: Saving trained models using pickle for reuse.

## Machine Learning Models Used

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

-**XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting model.


-**Decision Tree**: A simple tree-based model.


-**Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method.


-**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A model using hyperplanes for classification.


-**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based classifier.


-**Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**: A probabilistic classifier.
